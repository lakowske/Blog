  <p>Github push event deployment</p>
  <p>github-webhook-deployer listens for github push events.
    It's a sidecar-service that runs along side your
    service.  When a push event is received, github-webhook-deployer
    pulls the code and kills the current process.  A daemon manager, 
    such as forever, restarts the service with the new codebase 
    and you have deployed using a Github push event.
