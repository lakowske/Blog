  <p>Github push event deployment</p>
  <p>We'll be using github-webhook-deployer to listen for github
    push events.  It's a sidecar-service that runs along side your
    service.  When a push event is received, github-webhook-deployer
    pulls the code and kills the process.  A daemon manager, such as forever,
    restarts the service with the new codebase and you have deployed
    using a Github push event.
