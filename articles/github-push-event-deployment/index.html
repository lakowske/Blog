  <p>github-webhook-deployer listens for github push events.
    It's a sidecar-service that runs along side your
    service.  When a push event is received, github-webhook-deployer
    pulls the code and kills the current process.  A daemon manager, 
    such as forever, restarts the service with the new codebase 
    and you have deployed using a Github push event.

  <h2>Requirements</h2>

  <p>First, install nodejs if you haven't already.  Then create a directory
    to contain your project code.  Inside the new directory, run</p>

  <pre><code>
      #Initialize your project
      npm init
  </code></pre>
