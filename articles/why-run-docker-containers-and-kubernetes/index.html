    <ul>
      <li>Code can be broken out into smaller microservices that are easier to
        learn, release and update.</li>
      <li>Releasing a new service doesn't require
        coordination/synchronization across a whole company.</li>
      <li>Immutable containers can be created which improve
        security. Data can only be mutated in specified
        volumes, so root kits often can't be installed even if the system is
        penetrated.</li>
      <li>Lends itself to immutable infrastructure, so services are
        reloadable without state when a server goes down.</li>
      <li>Some clients will only host in private and not
        on public clouds.</li>
      <li>Both Docker and Kubernetes are free to use.</li>
      <li>Developers can run containers locally, rebuilding and verifying
        after each commit on a system that mirrors production.</li>
      <li>Service isolation without the heavyweight VM.  Adding a
      service to a server does not affect other services on the server.</li>
      <li>Services can be run on a large cluster of nodes making it
        more reliable.</li>
      <li>Access to Docker hub leverages the work of the opensource
        community.</li>
      <li>Increasing support for new hardware, like the GPU in a
      container means even gpgpu tasks like deep learning can be
        containerized.</li>
      
    </ul>
