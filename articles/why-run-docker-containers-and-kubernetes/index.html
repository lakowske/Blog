    <ul>
      <li>Service isolation without the heavyweight VM.  Adding a
      service to a server does not affect other services on the server</li>
      <li>Lends itself to immutable infrastructure, so services are
        reloadable without missing configuration when a server goes down</li>
      <li>Immutable containers can be created which improve
        security. Data can only be mutated in programmer specified
        volumes, so root kits can't be installed even if the system is
        penetrated.</li>
      <li>Services can be run on a large cluster of nodes making it
        more reliable</li>
      <li>Code can be broken out into smaller micro services that are easier to
        learn/release/update</li>
      <li>Some environments will only host in private clusters and not
        public clouds</li>
      <li>Both Docker and Kubernetes are free to use on a workstation
        or public/private cloud.</li>
      <li>Access to Docker hub leverages the work of the opensource
        community</li>
      <li>Developers can run containers locally, rebuilding verifying
        after each commit on a system that mirrors production</li>
    </ul>
