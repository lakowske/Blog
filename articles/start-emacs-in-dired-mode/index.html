      You can start emacs in dired mode by adding this to your startup script

      <pre><code>

	  (dired ".")
	  
      </code></pre>

      Next time you start emacs, your startup script will run and the dired command
      will be evaluated, <b>starting emacs in dired mode</b> at the current directory.
